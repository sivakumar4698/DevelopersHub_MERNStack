# Dissertation Project

The idea of this project is to develop a full stack web application using the MERN technology along with a built in recommendation system.

Refer to the final report documentation to understand the project in detail and how this full stack web application development has been acheived in a short duration of time.

This website was designed to help freelancers find jobs that they can work on. It helps business to find the freelancers who match the required skill sets. The recommendation system built in this application is "Content based filtering".
